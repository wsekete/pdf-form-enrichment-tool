# PDF Form Field Editor - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The PDF Form Field Editor is a Python-based tool that automatically parses PDF forms, extracts form field metadata, generates BEM-compliant API names using AI-powered contextual analysis, and writes changes back to the PDF while preserving document integrity. This tool addresses the critical bottleneck in our forms processing pipeline by automating the manual, time-consuming field renaming process.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Manual PDF form field renaming is time-intensive and error-prone
- Process requires Adobe Acrobat expertise  
- Major scalability bottleneck for company growth
- Inconsistent naming conventions across forms
- Risk of PDF corruption during manual editing

### Business Impact
- **Time**: 2-4 hours per form â†’ Target: 5-10 minutes
- **Accuracy**: 85-90% consistency â†’ Target: 98%+ consistency
- **Scalability**: Current team can process ~20 forms/week â†’ Target: 100+ forms/week
- **Quality**: Reduces downstream API integration issues

## Solution Overview

### Core Functionality
1. **PDF Form Analysis**: Extract form field metadata and contextual information
2. **AI-Powered Naming**: Generate BEM-compliant names using field context and training data
3. **Safe PDF Modification**: Update field properties while preserving document structure
4. **Validation & Review**: Comprehensive validation and human review interface
5. **Export & Integration**: Output modified PDFs with metadata for downstream systems

### Technology Stack
- **Primary**: Python 3.9+ with PyPDF library
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for contextual name generation
- **Validation**: Adobe PDF Services API (Get PDF Properties)
- **Data**: JSON for metadata handling
- **Interface**: CLI with optional web interface

## BEM Naming Convention

This tool follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention:

```
block_element__modifier
```

- **Block**: Form sections (e.g., `owner-information`, `payment`)
- **Element**: Individual fields (e.g., `name`, `email`, `phone-number`)  
- **Modifier**: Field variations (e.g., `first`, `last`, `primary`)

### Examples

- `owner-information_name`
- `owner-information_name__first`
- `payment_amount__gross`
- `signatures_owner`

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Processing Time**: 90% reduction from manual process
- **Accuracy Rate**: 95%+ BEM naming compliance
- **Error Rate**: <2% PDF corruption or functionality loss
- **User Adoption**: 100% of forms team using tool within 30 days

### Secondary Metrics
- **Throughput**: 10x increase in forms processed per week
- **Consistency**: 98% adherence to naming conventions
- **User Satisfaction**: 9/10 ease-of-use rating
- **Support Tickets**: <5% related to field naming issues
