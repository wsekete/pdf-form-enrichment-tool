# Error handling
"I encountered an issue with field 15 - it appears to be corrupted in the PDF structure. I've skipped it for now and continued with the remaining fields. Would you like me to try a different approach for that field, or shall we proceed with the 22 successfully processed fields?"

**Error Recovery Examples**:
```python
# PDF corruption error
"I detected some corruption in your PDF file around field 15. Let me try a few recovery techniques:

1. First, I'll attempt to skip the corrupted field and continue with the others...
   ✓ Successfully processed 22 of 23 fields
   
2. For the corrupted field, I can try extracting it using a different method...
   ✗ Alternative extraction failed
   
3. Would you like me to:
   - Generate a report excluding the corrupted field?
   - Try processing the PDF with different settings?
   - Help you repair the PDF using external tools?"

# API rate limit error
"I hit the AI API rate limit while processing your form. No worries - I'll automatically retry in 30 seconds. In the meantime, I can:

- Continue processing using the built-in naming rules (slightly lower accuracy)
- Queue your request and process it when the rate limit resets
- Switch to a different AI provider if you have backup credentials configured

What would you prefer?"
```

**Validation**:
- Test error recovery with various failure scenarios
- Verify guided resolution steps are clear and effective
- Confirm learning system improves recovery over time
- Test escalation paths work correctly

```

**Batch Conversation Examples**:
```python
# User: "I have 15 forms that all need the same BEM naming treatment"
"Perfect! I can batch process all 15 forms using consistent naming rules. Here's what I'll do:

1. Upload all 15 PDFs
2. Apply the same configuration to each form
3. Process them in parallel (3 at a time for optimal performance)
4. Generate a consolidated report of all changes

Would you like to upload them now, or would you prefer to configure any special settings first?"

# Progress update
"Batch processing update: 8/15 forms complete (53%)
- 7 forms processed successfully with average 94% confidence
- 1 form had minor issues but completed successfully
- Currently processing: application_form_2024.pdf
- Estimated completion: 3 minutes

The processed forms are looking great - consistent naming across all files!"
```

**Validation**:
- Test batch processing with 10-20 PDF files
- Verify progress tracking accuracy across batch operations
- Confirm error handling doesn't stop entire batch
- Test batch reporting provides actionable insights
