# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The PDF Form Enrichment Tool is an AI-powered Python application that automates the process of renaming PDF form fields to BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming conventions. It transforms a 2-4 hour manual task into a 5-10 minute automated workflow, providing 10x throughput improvement for forms processing teams.


## Things to Keep in mind

I would like to emphasize that this is to be a production-ready application. Think hard. Think deeply. Ultra-think if needed. Get into the weeds

**That means**: 
- **STRIVE** for the most complete implementation possible
- I need you to think hard and create a **detailed plan** for each item in each task 
- If there is a real-world example we can use to fine-tune the codebase, we **need** to use it
- If there is training data that we can use to fine-tune the codebase, we **need** to use it 
- If you don’t see the information or data you need, then you **need** to ask me for it
- **use real world examples from the training data** rather than mocks 
- **Tests must be designed to test complete, real-world pdf forms** — mocks will not suffice
- Do your absolute best work on this task. Less than that will not be acceptable. 
- I believe in your abilities. Completing a task successfully means we get to move on to more fun projects

As we work you **need** to:
- check old passive context in CLAUDE.md
- keep CLAUDE.md up to date
- add new passive context to CLAUDE.md each time you code

## Critical Code Review Fixes Applied

**Phase 1 & 2 Security & Stability Hardening** - ✅ **COMPLETE**

Following comprehensive code reviews, all critical issues have been resolved:

**Memory & Performance Fixes**:
- ✅ Fixed memory leak in field caching - added `clear_cache()` methods to FieldExtractor and ContextExtractor
- ✅ Added circular reference protection in field hierarchy parsing to prevent infinite recursion
- ✅ Fixed integer overflow in child field ID generation using string-based IDs

**Security & Safety Fixes**:
- ✅ Fixed unsafe dictionary access with proper null checks and safe access patterns
- ✅ Implemented safe array access with length validation for field coordinates
- ✅ Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization

**Architecture & Code Quality**:
- ✅ Removed duplicate CSVFieldMapping definition, consolidated to single source
- ✅ Fixed circular import issues with dependency injection pattern
- ✅ Replaced all magic numbers with configuration constants (FieldExtractionConstants, PDFConstants, TrainingConstants)
- ✅ Improved error handling with specific exception types and detailed error reporting

**Configuration Constants Added**:
- Field extraction thresholds and proximity values
- PDF processing constants (page layout, visual grouping, field flags)
- Training data correlation and confidence weights
- Error handling and validation thresholds

The codebase is now production-ready with enterprise-grade stability, security, and maintainability.

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Testing Philosophy**: Every test must show EVERY SINGLE FIELD from each PDF for complete verification and transparency. No field limits, no abbreviated results - full extraction and processing visibility.

**Testing Standards**:
- ✅ **Complete Field Verification**: Show all fields without omission (e.g., all 98 fields from FAFF-0009AO.13)
- ✅ **Preservation Mode Required**: Always run with `--preservation-mode` enabled
- ✅ **Real-World Forms**: Use actual PDF forms, not mocks or artificial test data
- ✅ **Tabular Output**: Detailed tables showing field IDs, original names, BEM names, types, confidence scores
- ✅ **Statistical Analysis**: Preservation rates, improvement rates, field type breakdowns
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Processing time, memory usage, success rates
- ✅ **Training Data Integration**: Validate 4,838+ examples are loaded and utilized

**Standard Test Output Format**:
```
🔍 COMPLETE VERIFICATION: [Form Name]
📄 File: [PDF Path]
🎯 Showing EVERY SINGLE FIELD - No Limits

📊 PRESERVATION STATISTICS (ALL FIELDS):
   • Total Fields: [N]
   • Preserved: [N] ([%])
   • Improved: [N] ([%])
   • Restructured: [N] ([%])
   • Success Rate: [%]

[Complete tabular output showing ALL fields with:]
# | Field ID | Original Name | BEM Generated Name | Type | Page | Action | Confidence | Coordinates

✅ VERIFICATION COMPLETE: ALL [N] FIELDS SHOWN ABOVE
```

**Required Test Cases**:
1. **Simple Form Testing**: Basic forms (W-4R) - validate high preservation rates
2. **Complex Form Testing**: Multi-page forms (FAFF-0009AO.13) - validate radio button hierarchies
3. **Desktop Form Testing**: Real-world forms (LIFE-1528-Q_BLANK) - validate mixed field types
4. **CLI Integration Testing**: Command-line `--preservation-mode` functionality
5. **Performance Testing**: Processing time <5 seconds per form
6. **Training Data Testing**: Validate 4,838+ examples loaded successfully

**Verification Requirements**:
- Every field extraction result must be visible in output
- All preservation actions must be clearly marked (✅ Preserved, 🔄 Improved, 🔧 Restructured)
- Field coordinates and page numbers must be shown for verification
- Confidence scores and reasoning must be documented
- No truncation or "showing first N fields" limitations allowed

This comprehensive testing approach ensures complete transparency and verification of the preservation mode BEM generation system across all field types and form complexities.
